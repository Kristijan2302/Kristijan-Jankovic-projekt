        The Indiana Pacers injury-plagued season continues to get even more difficult. Starting point guard Malcolm Brogdon was shut for at least 10 days to deal with soreness in his right Achilles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Brogdon has missed considerable time over the last month. He was out for nine straight games in late-December into early-January.
    </p>
    <p>
        He's only been able to play in three of the Pacers last 17 games overall.
    </p>
    <p>
        Indiana is also without fellow starters Domantas Sabonis, Myles Turner and Caris LeVert, as well as sixth-man T.J. McConnell. In addition, T.J. Warren has yet to play this season as he rehabs from a foot injury.
    </p>
    <p>
        All of the absences have seen the Pacers tumble to 13th in the Eastern Conference, where they are six games out of the final spot in the Play-In tournament.
